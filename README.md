### What I learned

This Challenge was kinda hard to me due to image size adjusting on the desktop device
I managed to do it somehow but I think I writed a lot of css to achieve that
I think there is somehow simple way to do that.

I will make the code more readable and simple to look at that's what I am planning for.
